# dist_break

Distributed video transcoder based on HandBrake and Celery.


## Dependencies

Install all python requirements using pip:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

You also have to install Handbrake or rather HandBrakeCLI on all slaves.

  apt install handbrake-cli

The master needs to install a broker for celery. Currently only RabbitMQ is
supported and tested. You should configure a user for dist_break in RabbitMQ.

  apt install rabbitmq-server
